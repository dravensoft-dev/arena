# Arena brand components, the React layer

Every brand component this layer ships, under the names it binds them to. **This page is an
index, not a manual.** How to write one is its own prompt, linked in the last column.

**The rules every component below answers to are stated in
[`../../../../skills/design/SKILL.md`](../../../../skills/design/SKILL.md) before any component
here**, and nothing on this page restates them.

Import from the package root, never from a path inside it:

```tsx
import { ArenaButton, ArenaTag } from '@dravensoft/arena-react';
```

A member is a prop. The main slot is `children`, a named slot is a prop taking a node, and an
event is an `on`-prefixed handler. An icon is a Phosphor class-name string, never an element.

- Every other category this layer ships: [`../../INDEX.md`](../../INDEX.md).
- Installing the package, declaring your skin, and what it exports besides components:
  [`../../PACKAGE.md`](../../PACKAGE.md).
- **Takes** is the members the component's API contract declares, in contract order, under this
  layer's own names. A member marked `*` is required; the prompt gives its type and its default.
- **A member whose type is an object or an enum takes one this package exports.** The prompt
  names the type and says what it is for; the fields it holds are in the type declaration itself,
  which `import type { … } from '@dravensoft/arena-react'` brings in. That field list is in neither
  the prompt nor the contract, so the type is where you read it.

| Component | What it is | Takes | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ArenaAppLogo` | Brand lock-up: a mark beside or above a product name. | `mark*` `name*` `dim` `size` `orientation` | [`ArenaAppLogo.prompt.md`](./arena-app-logo/ArenaAppLogo.prompt.md) |
